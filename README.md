Simple practice problems: data structures and algorithms

## Search array
Given a (m x n) 2D-array with ordered lines and columns (e.g. [[1,2,3], [2,3,4]]), find a given element $a$.

Ideas:
- Use the ordered structure to implement a recursive algorithm.
- First notice: the bottom right element is the maximal element of the array.
- If this element is smaller
